# mldl_rgb-d_da_project
Project for a different implementation for DA on RGB-D pictures

To run the code:

1) create a dataset folder, check train.sh to see how to create it
2) download datasets and put the dataset folder into the Implementation folder
3) if running on linux, run the train.sh script in the same folder of the python scripts

Paper based on:

1) https://github.com/MRLoghmani/relative-rotation directly derived paper for rotation
2) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11825.pdf suggesting to implement multiple tasks for recognition
